# Food Waste Website

https://kaileyliou.github.io/Food-Waste/index.html

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a website about the issue of food waste (the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 12.3). I included a home page, learn more page, and take action page which include a fact generator and a personalized pledge.
