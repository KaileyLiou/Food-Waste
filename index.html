        <h2>The Waste Is Real. The Impact Is Bigger.</h2>

        <p>Each year, about 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted. This leads to many negative consequences, including hunger, poverty, and climate change. Food waste is becoming more and more of an issue that it is part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 12.3. We need to take action sooner rather than later and stop ignoring this critical issue.</p>

        <p class = "fact">Americans waste about 60 million tons of food every year.</p>
